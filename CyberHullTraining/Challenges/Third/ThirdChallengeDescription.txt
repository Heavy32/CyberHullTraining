Challenge - Methods
In this challenge you will deepen your understanding for methods.
Please go ahead and create three variables with names of your friends.
Then create a Method "GreetFriend" which writes something like: "Hi Frank, my friend!" onto the console, once it is called.
Where "Frank" should be replaced with the Name behind the argument given to the Method when it's called. So the method will need a parameter (decide which DataType will be best). 

Greet all your three friends.
