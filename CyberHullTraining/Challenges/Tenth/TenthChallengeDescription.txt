Write a program that will iterate through each element of the students array and insert them into a hastable.
If a student with the same Id already exists in the hashtable skip it and display the following error:
"Sorry, a student with the same Id already exists".
Hint: use the method ContainsKey() to check whether a student with the same Id already exists
